If Disney parks are known for anything other than being a magical place, it's lines. Waiting in line at Disney is inevitable. So how should you spend all that time? Check out our favorite line activities below.

### 1. Have a line snack
I still think back fondly on the frozen pink lemonade that got me through the 2.5 hour line during the early days of Disneyland's Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage. Digging into the frozen solid lemonade with a plastic spoon kept me busy and cool on a hot day. Some other good line snacks include:
- **Popcorn**: How can you resist that smell??? If you're in Tokyo Disney, you can even get flavored popcorn.
- **Mickey's premium ice cream bar**: A classic and a Neverland Diaries favorite. Best when just a little bit melted, this ice cream bar features creamy vanilla ice cream enveloped by rich chocolate.
- **Dole Whip**: Another classic (and likely another line to wait in), Dole Whip is a soft-serve, pineapple-flavored dessert that has a smooth and creamy texture. It is also a dairy-free and vegan-friendly dessert, so don't say I didn't include anything for ya filthy vegans out there! (I say that with love)
- **Casey's corn dog nuggets**: A Magic Kingdom exclusive, unfortunately, but these corn dogs are the stuff dreams are made of, assuming your dreams are made up of tiny portions of hot dog dipped in sweet cornbread batter, with a little ketchup and mustard on the side, if you wish!
- **A draaank**: Maybe you're not hungry, but I bet you could use a drink! If you're not at Magic Kingdom or Disneyland, you can even work up a bit of a buzz while you wait in line.
<br /><br />
**One last note**: Do be mindful of what ride you're going on before you stuff yourself with food, and don't blame me if you get nauseous.

### 2. Play a game
- **Charades app**: Probably one of the most popular line activities, the Charades app is--you guessed it--a digital version of charades. With a variety of themes (including Disney!) and difficulty levels, this app will have you guessing and giggling throughout the line.
- **[Spaceteam app](https://spaceteam.ca/)**: This fast-paced cooperative game requires players to communicate and coordinate to prevent their spaceship from falling apart. It's a hectic blast.
- **[Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes app](https://keeptalkinggame.com/)**: The idea is simple: one person has a bomb on their screen, and the others must provide instructions to defuse it. It's a race against time that will keep your adrenaline pumping. Unlike the other two, this app is NOT free, but only one person needs the app itself to play in a group of up to... well, as many people as you can handle talking at you at once, really.
- **Win, Lose, Banana**: A physical but small handheld game for three players and consisting of three cards, Win, Lose, Banana tests how good you and your friends are at fabricating lies and being persuasive. If you draw the Win card, congrats--you won! Or did you? Now you get to decide whom you share your win with. If you pick the person who got Banana, you both win, but if you choose the person who got the Lose card, they win and you lose. Players can describe what's on their card to convince you they have the Banana card, or use any other methods of persuasion.
- **[Play Disney Parks App](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/play-app/)**: Yes, Disney has come out with their own app precisely for giving you something to do while you wait in line. It has trivia, games, and achievements. It's frankly fairly mediocre, but when in Rome, right?

### 3. Get to know each other better...
...through more games! Listen, we love games here.
- **Play Never Have I Ever**: Take turns sharing things you have never done before, and see who in your group has had the most adventurous experiences. If you're playing an R-rated version, please whisper it; there are children present!
- **Play Would You Rather**: Pose thought-provoking dilemmas and ask others to choose between two challenging options. The answers can be hilarious and reveal a lot about each person's preferences. Here's one to get you started: Would you rather have a sideways butt or backwards ears?
- **Play "Imagineer That"**: Okay, we made this one up, but it's one we play all the time. Pick a ride and re-imagine it, or pick a Disney IP and come up with a ride for it together. Why not pretend to be an imagineer for a day?
